  "Summary": "Infinite loop on input file with read-only attribute.",
  "Description": "If an input file has the 'read-only' attribute, the app can not move the processed file into the destination directory: so the app processes the file again and thus falls into the infinite loop.",
  "Expected_Result": "The processed file is moved from the input directory to the destination directory.",
  "Actual_Result": "The processed data (new file) appears inside the destination directory, but the original file is not deleted from the input directory.",
  "Req": "DS-2.1",
  "Steps_To_Reproduce": "1. Place a valid file into the input directory. 2. Set the 'read-only' attribute on this file. 3. Start the app.",
  "Bug": "The processing result appears inside the destination dir (and the file is repeatedly updated according to the last write time), but the original file stays inside the input directory.",
  "Reproducibility": "Always",
  "Severity": "Medium",
  "Priority": "Normal",
  "Symptom": "Incorrect operation",
  "Workaround": "No",
  "Comments": "If the customer has no special plans for using 'read-only' attribute on files in the input directory, the easiest solution is to remove the attribute once it is detected.",
  "Attachments": null
